I have been bashing my face into a wall trying to port music for splatoon 3 (this tool is not aimed at splatoon 1 and 2 but might be made at a later date)
it got really tedious having to go from one program to another all the time and even manually hex editing a couple times to get everything to work properly-ish,
so i decided maybe its time i make my own GUI tool that adresses problems i have with existing tools and feature help buttons and hover text that show a step-by-step proccess of how to port music specifically for splatoon 3.
hopefully this tool will make it easier to port multiple songs at once and stuff like that.

note- im just starting out and theres nothing functional here yet
